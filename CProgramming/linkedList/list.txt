Reversing a singly linked list iteratively or recursively.
Detecting and removing cycles in a singly linked list using Floydâ€™s algorithm or hashing.
Merging two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.
Splitting a singly linked list into two halves using slow and fast pointers.
Finding the middle element, the nth element from the end, or the intersection point of two singly linked lists.
